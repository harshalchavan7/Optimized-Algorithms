## Linear Search
Linear Search is a method for searching an element in a collection of elements. In Linear Search, each element of the collection is visited one by one in a sequential fashion to find the desired element. Linear Search is also known as Sequential Search.

Algorithm for Linear Search Algorithm:
The algorithm for linear search can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Start: Begin at the first element of the collection of elements.
2. Compare: Compare the current element with the desired element.
3. Found: If the current element is equal to the desired element, return true or index to the current element.
4. Move: Otherwise, move to the next element in the collection.
5. Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until we have reached the end of collection.
6. Not found: If the end of the collection is reached without finding the desired element, return that the desired element is not in the array.
